# RailGrievance

This RailGrievance AI application allows users to upload PDF files containing rail ticket information to automatically extract key details such as the PNR number, train name, and seat number. Additionally, it enables users to describe their grievances, which the app then categorizes into specific types (e.g., security-related issues) using natural language processing (NLP). The app is designed to streamline the grievance submission process by automating data extraction and classification, making it easier for users to lodge their complaints effectively.
